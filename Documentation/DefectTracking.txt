Defect Description: In our isMoveValid() function if a piece was against the edge of the board it would be able to go to the opposite edge of the board 2 rows up into a tan square.
Fix description: To fix this problem I made it check if the square the piece was selected to move to's class was "tan-sqr" then it would return that the move was invalid and thus not go through.
