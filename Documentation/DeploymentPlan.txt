DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
	With our Checkers game, it would be very simple to deploy our game to a web server, such as AWS. 
	In order to achieve this, we would need to sign up for AWS. Specifially we would want their Single Web App Hosting feature,
	as it is a static website that only requires a single load in a web browser. This would be ideal for our Checkers game.
	AWS Amplify Console has a free trial, but afterwards we would have to pay as we go. For instance, it would cost
	$0.023 per GB stored per month, or $0.15 per GB served. 
	After deciding on our web host, we would then need to register a domain name. 

POTENTIAL MARKET:
	Our potential market would be anyone and everyone. Checkers is a simple game that many of us are introduced to as young children.
	Therefore, our game would have no defined audience as it is easily accessible. 

COST TO DEPLOY:
	As stated previously, it would cost us fractions of a dollar to deploy our game to AWS. Additionally, we would need to spend at least $7/year to keep our domain name.
	Furthermore, our product could be adapted to be played on mobile devices, but in doing so would cost us a few hundred dollars if we were to release our game through the App Store.
	This probably wouldn't be a viable option to be able to upload to the App Store, as I don't see us charging money to play our game. 
	So, we would probably want to stay on the cheaper side of things and only host our game on a website.
	Lastly, we could always implement ads into our game in order to generate revenue from people playing our game.
