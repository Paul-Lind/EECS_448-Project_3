PROJECTED COSTS:
	Our game will cost relatively little to host, so we could expect to have to pay anywhere between $10-$20 for the course of one year, 
	including domain costs. However, if we see a lot of traffic on our site, we could experience higher costs as there would be more usage.
	To combat this, we could always implement ads into our game in order to generate revenue. 

UPDATES:
	We could implement updates to our game in order to ensure it has a long lifespan. For instance, we could implement seasonal changes to the game
	such as a Winter update, or a Fall update, and adjust the graphics of the game accordingly. Furthermore, we could implement different game modes into our 
	Checkers game, such as a smaller board, only King pieces, or double jumping is allowed. These small tweaks and updates would bring new life to our game,
	and we might find success with keeping players, and also adding new players to our game. 
	None of these updates would require additional developers to be hired, as these can all easily be managed by a small team.
